      <br>
      <h4>Step 1: Consult & Discuss</h4>
      <br>
      <!-- Talk about how you will discuss ofshoring requirements -->
      <p>The first priority we have when you first consult with us is discussing your offshoring requirements. We want to make
      sure that your company first has the tools and resources to be able to work with us. Some of this includes internal processes
    documented, licenses/certifications that allow you to offshore, and access to cloud tools. Usually, you would also need a CRM that in
  accessible remotely, but we would be more than happy to provide you with our CRM software as a bundle.</p>
      <br>
      <div class="bullet-list">
      <p> When meeting up with one of our staff one on one regarding offshoring, we will be asking questions such as: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> For what business process do you need an offshore team for?</li>
        <li> Who will this offshore team report to?</li>
        <li> How many of your staff will our team be working with?</li>
        <li> How is your flexibility in the workplace regarding a remote environment?</li>
        <li> What are your business goals and objectives for this specific sector?</li>
        <li> What are your current employment costs?</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p> From these answers, we will work to put together our own customized solution that meets all of your needs.</p>
      <p> We will also discuss more into job descriptions for our offshoring team so that we can take the steps to pick out the optimal
      candidates for the job.</p>
      <div class="horizontal-line">

      </div>
      <br>
      <h4>Step 2: Recruit</h4>
      <br>
      <!-- Replace text -->
      <p> As mentioned above, from looking at the job descriptions that you require from us we then turn to our company and pick out the
      candidates we think are best for the job. From there when selecting our best workers, we will leave the decision up to your executive
    team to decide who to have on the offshore team through any sort of interviewing process. </p>
      <br>
      <p> After interviews have been conducted and you have successfully identified the candidates most qualified, we will then take the steps
      to arrange how they will be working and communicating with your team. Additionally, we will install any softwares and licenses that are
    needed such that our team is able to provide the best performance as well as provide your company with more awareness about logistical information regarding
    specific things in your business process(e.x budgeting in accounting).
  </p>
      <div class="horizontal-line">

      </div>
      <br>
      <h4>Step 3: Support</h4>
      <br>
      <!-- Replace text -->
      <p> Once everything is all set up, our team can start training, learning how to use your systems, and make sure the team is
      all caught up to speed with company processes. After training, you can begin assigning them tasks for what to do and through
    your systems be able to monitor them and make sure that productivity is good and that all tasks are organized/spread out properly amongst the team.</p>
    <br>
    <p> We will have a specialist head that is supporting your operations and helping you to monitor over our offshore team. This includes factors
    such as IT deployment, ensuring staff productivity is high, giving advice to staff, ongoing recruitment, HR, and facilities management support, management
  of any compliance matters.</p>
  <br>
  <p> This ensures that you are effectively in charge of ensuring quality and efficiency with work as well as have the time to focus on your own core business
  processes. Our number one goal is to ensure your growth in your business and being able to help you achieve your business objectives.</p>
